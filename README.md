## About

*Memento-Mori* is a simple Python/Kivy app that calculates the approximate number of weeks you have lived and how many may remain based on a typical life expectancy. It combines a visualization of life in weeks with carefully selected inspirational quotes, encouraging reflection on the passage of time.

The app gently reminds users to make every week count.

## Project Story

Life is fleeting, and sometimes we forget just how precious every moment is. *Memento-Mori* was born from the desire to pause, reflect, and inspire mindfulness about how we spend our time.

By visualizing your life in weeks and pairing it with inspirational quotes, the app provides a small but meaningful reminder: each week matters, and life is a journey meant to be lived fully—whether you're starting out, enjoying your golden years, or reflecting on a life well lived.
